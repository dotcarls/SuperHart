# Super Hart

Super Hart is a homebrew GameBoy Game created with [GB Studio](https://gbstudio.dev) + [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama). 

## Plot

You play as Hart, a human person. Other human people pay Hart to walk their canine companion. 

## Mechanics

### Player Movement

The goal for player movement is to embody the joke "are you walking your dog, or is your dog walking you?" 

* Player is 'pulled forward' by dogs
    * more dogs === more speed
    * player can not move backwards 
    * dogs can pull player slightly 'off track'

### Player Objective / Scoring

The players objective should be simple: to walk dogs. The type of walk the player is on is determined by the game, either story driven through requests from dog owners, or through arcade style challenges. 

Types of walk / challenges:

* Distance based
    * shortest / longest walk between houses
    * ordering / puzzle oriented via restricted movement map
* Time based
    * finish before owners return
    * number of dogs walked within in a time range
* Score based
    * bonus points for POIs along non-optimal paths
    * penalties for dog behavior
